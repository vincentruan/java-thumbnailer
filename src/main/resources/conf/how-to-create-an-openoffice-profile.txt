How to create an OpenOffice Profile
===================================

JODConverter can create a new profile, but if you want to set openoffice-Preferences or just save that overhead, this is how you can create a profile folder. (JODConverter will actually only use copies of it, so it won't get modified.)

1. Go to the commandline and type:

   soffice -env:UserInstallation=[profile dir here]

   (You may need to go to the OpenOffice-Directory first.)
2. Now Openoffice starts within this profile, creating it if it didn't exist yet.
3. Change any preferences you like.
4. Close the window.

Now go to CrawlerConfiguration.xml and tell the JavaThumbnailer where to look for a such profile (scroll down to crawlerPlugin > section:externalHelpers > param:openOfficeProfile )
